## Skills (human index)

This repo follows the Codex skills standard:

- A skill is a folder containing a required `SKILL.md` (with YAML front matter) plus optional `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`.
- In a working repo, Codex loads repo-scoped skills from `.codex/skills/**`.

References:
- Codex skills standard: [`https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/)
- Example skills library repo: [`https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills`](https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills)

### Canonical location in this repo

**Canonical (Codex-loaded) skills live under**:

- `.codex/skills/**`

We keep this `skills/` folder as a **human-friendly index** (similar to the public skills library layout) without duplicating the canonical skill definitions.
