# Requirements

This folder splits requirements into functional vs non-functional.

## Requirement themes (narrative)
The requirements are organized around three pillars: fair progression, deep experimentation, and in-chat continuity. Fair progression protects the relaxed idle gamer from coercive monetization and pacing stalls. Deep experimentation protects the strategist from shallow loops by exposing measurement and comparison tools. In-chat continuity protects the chat-native explorer from losing context and progress.

Fair progression requirements prioritize transparency in the economy. The ledger and fairness pledge are product contract statements that keep retention from collapsing when optional spend appears. Requirements emphasize clear labeling and a no-paywall rule so that players can make low-pressure decisions.

Short-session pacing is a critical theme. The return recap ensures the player sees progress from time away, while adaptive milestones prevent stalling and repetitive grind. These requirements are treated as part of the core loop rather than optional “nice to have” features.

Discovery and novelty requirements maintain delight. The product must supply visual and narrative payoffs that make the colony feel alive, otherwise the loop becomes a series of numbers with no emotion. The discovery cadence requirements specify how often novelty should appear and require telemetry to confirm that it is happening.

Deep experimentation requirements are anchored in the strategist persona. The experiment notebook, benchmark arena, and forecast lens establish a framework for testing hypotheses about colony behavior. Without these tools, strategists will perceive the simulation as shallow even if the underlying system is complex.

In-chat continuity requirements exist because the in-chat experience is fragile. Any loss of state or inconsistent store behavior undermines trust quickly. Requirements like the trust vault and cross-surface handshake are elevated to P0 priority to keep continuity visible.

Non-functional requirements are framed as product requirements, not engineering constraints. Performance thresholds are set based on persona expectations, and sync SLOs are treated as trust signals. This ensures that reliability is part of the product promise.

Traceability is a requirement principle. Each requirement is linked to personas and propositions so the team can identify which user need is addressed. This keeps downstream feature work grounded in research.
