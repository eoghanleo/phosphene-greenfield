## 6.1a Requirement rationale
Functional requirements are grouped to protect fairness, pacing, experimentation, and in-chat continuity. The PRD treats these as user promises rather than implementation details. Each requirement should be traceable to a proposition and persona so that the team can validate whether the experience is delivering on its stated value. This rationale section exists to prevent requirements from becoming a list of features without purpose.

Requirements connected to fairness and monetization are elevated to P0 because they address the most explicit pain signal in research. The fair progress loop, economy ledger, and no-paywall rule all reinforce trust that optional spend will not distort core progression. When these are missing or poorly executed, the loop feels manipulative and short-session retention declines. Therefore, requirements in this category demand visible cues and measurable behaviors, not just hidden backend logic.

Pacing and discovery requirements are the second-most critical because they determine whether a player returns after the first session. The return recap is both a narrative and operational device: it reminds players that time away is rewarded rather than punished. Adaptive milestones and discovery cadence ensure that the loop does not collapse into repetition. These requirements should be tested for both immediate delight and long-term sustainability, since too much novelty can become noise.

Experimentation requirements are framed as user-facing research tools for PER-0002. The experiment notebook and benchmark arena are not just gamified features; they are how strategists learn whether the simulation is deep enough to invest time. If these tools are shallow or inconsistent, the strategist persona will interpret the game as superficial. Therefore, experiment requirements include explicit comparison outputs and performance metrics to ensure the results feel credible.

In-chat continuity requirements address the fragile nature of chat-native experiences. Any loss of state or inconsistent store behavior undermines trust quickly. For this persona, even a small inconsistency is a major break in immersion. Requirements like the trust vault, receipt archive, and cross-surface handshake are included to make continuity visible and verifiable.

Finally, growth and social requirements are prioritized after the trust and pacing pillars are satisfied. Social proof and creator spotlights can boost acquisition, but they must not degrade the calm, fair experience. If they add pressure or clutter, they will hurt retention. These requirements are therefore lower priority and are expected to be tuned carefully based on cohort data.
