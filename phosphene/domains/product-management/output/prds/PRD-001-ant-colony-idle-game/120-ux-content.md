# 12) UX, Content, and Accessibility

## 12.1 UX principles and constraints
- Every screen should answer: “What changed?” and “What’s the next best action?”
- Avoid clutter early; progressive disclosure for strategist tools.

The experience should feel calm and transparent. Players should never wonder whether a change came from real progress or from a monetization mechanic. The UI should therefore surface clear labels for optional purchases and highlight the impact of those purchases on colony state. This transparency is central to maintaining trust with PER-0001 and PER-0002.

## 12.2 Content plan
- Discovery moments include short, charming captions and optional science facts.
- Story moments connect progress to ant colony behaviors (PROP-0007, PROP-0022).

Content must be lightweight enough to fit short sessions while still offering novelty. Each discovery moment should include a one-sentence summary and an optional “learn more” expansion for curious players. This keeps PER-0001 engaged without overwhelming them, while giving PER-0002 the depth they seek. For PER-0003, content should be framed as chat-friendly snippets that can be shared without losing context.

## 12.3 Accessibility
- Provide adjustable text sizes, contrast, and a calm mode (R-SPEC-053, R-CORE-008).

Accessibility features should be discoverable in onboarding and re-surface when players enable quiet or comfort modes. This ensures that adjustments are not hidden in settings and that players who need them can immediately find relief. These adjustments also support the relaxed tone of the game and reinforce the fairness narrative by showing care for player comfort.

## 12.4 Scenario walkthroughs
**Scenario A: Short-session return (PER-0001).** The player opens the game after a day away and immediately sees a return recap card. The recap highlights food gathered, a new tunnel unlocked, and a suggested upgrade with a clear explanation of why it matters. The player taps the upgrade, sees a short discovery animation, and exits within two minutes feeling satisfied. This scenario validates the short-session promise and is the baseline for measuring recap effectiveness.

**Scenario B: Experiment session (PER-0002).** The strategist launches a benchmark arena, selects two colony snapshots, and runs a comparison. The system provides a scorecard with efficiency deltas and a short commentary on which lever drove the change. The strategist then opens the experiment notebook and logs a new hypothesis for the next run. This scenario validates that the simulation feels measurable and that the tooling encourages deeper play.

**Scenario C: In-chat return (PER-0003).** The player returns to a chat thread and sees a continuity indicator confirming the colony is synced. A short discovery pulse appears with a shareable moment, and an AI prompt offers a brief explanation of the new behavior. The player accepts a small optional upgrade in-chat and receives an immediate receipt with rollback instructions. This scenario validates that continuity and commerce feel trustworthy in a conversational context.
