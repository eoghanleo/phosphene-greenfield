## Executive summary

ID: PRD-001

# 1) Executive Summary

## 1.1 One-paragraph summary
The Ant Colony Idle Game is a browser-first, idle simulation experience that targets relaxed idle gamers, systems-driven strategists, and in-chat explorers with a fair, transparent economy and a charming ant colony loop. It delivers short-session progress, visible colony evolution, and optional depth for experimentation while keeping monetization optional and trustworthy. The scope emphasizes WebGPU-backed simulation, an approachable idle cadence, and an in-chat companion surface to keep continuity and guidance intact. Validation focuses on whether fair monetization and delightful discovery can retain casual players while proving sufficient depth for strategists and trust for in-chat persistence.

## 1.2 The problem
- **Current user pain:** Idle players abandon games when monetization feels coercive or progression becomes repetitive and overwhelming (E-0001, E-0003). Strategists disengage when simulation depth is shallow or pay-to-win shortcuts compromise legitimacy (E-0005, E-0013). In-chat explorers churn if context switching or unreliable persistence breaks immersion (E-0009, E-0010).
- **Business pain:** Browser-based distribution is difficult without a differentiated channel, and ChatGPT Apps are promising but unproven, making early retention and monetization validation critical (E-0007, E-0009).
- **Why now:** WebGPU makes richer in-browser simulation feasible while ChatGPT App surfaces offer a high-upside distribution wedge if persistence and trust can be established (E-0009, E-0010).

## 1.3 The solution (high-level)
- **Primary capability:** A fair-progress idle loop that turns short sessions into visible colony growth, backed by transparent optional monetization.
- **Key differentiators:** Observable ant behaviors, experiment-friendly strategy tools, and in-chat continuity with AI guidance.
- **Constraints that shape the solution:** Monetization must be optional and transparent; the sim must feel credible in a browser; persistence must be reliable across chat and web contexts.

## 1.4 What “success” looks like
- **User success:** Casual players complete satisfying 3–5 minute sessions with visible progress, strategists can run meaningful experiments, and in-chat explorers can return without fear of lost state.
- **Business success:** Early cohorts show retention above idle-game benchmarks with steady ARPDAU from optional spend and minimal ad fatigue.
- **Operational success:** Web performance meets stability targets and the persistence system avoids data-loss incidents.

## 1.5 Validation focus (first 6–8 weeks)
The first validation sprint must answer whether a fair economy and transparent pacing is enough to retain casual idle players without aggressive paywalls. It must also show that strategists perceive enough depth to keep experimenting after the first week, and that in-chat explorers trust persistence enough to return and purchase optional upgrades. These validation questions are prioritized over polish; the product should be instrumented to measure return recap usage, experiment completion, and sync success as leading indicators. If any of these fail, the roadmap should pivot to deeper simulation tooling or to a web-only distribution plan.

## 1.6 Evidence notes
The RA-001 research suggests strong genre demand for idle simulations but highlights monetization sensitivity and platform distribution risk. The PRD treats these as constraints rather than assumptions: every monetization-related requirement enforces optionality, and every distribution-related requirement includes a web fallback. Where research confidence is medium or low, the requirements include explicit validation steps before scaling.

## 1.7 Scope clarifications
This PRD deliberately limits itself to a fair-progress idle simulation rather than an expansive narrative game. The goal is to validate a sustainable loop before investing in complex story arcs or competitive systems. This scope keeps the product focused on fairness, pacing, and depth rather than on content volume. It also ensures that in-chat continuity can be tested without the overhead of a large content library.

The scope also excludes aggressive monetization mechanics. Any mechanic that creates hard paywalls or forces ad viewing is considered a violation of the fairness proposition. Optional spending is allowed only when it is clearly labeled and when it does not distort the strategic outcomes for PER-0002. This limitation may reduce short-term revenue, but it is essential for long-term trust and retention.

Finally, the scope is experimental with respect to in-chat distribution. The product will launch in chat only after persistence reliability is validated in web contexts. This prevents a premature launch in a fragile channel and protects the brand promise of continuity. If in-chat adoption is lower than expected, the product should still be viable as a browser-first simulation.

## Product context

ID: PRD-001

# 2) Product Context and Strategy

## 2.1 Product narrative
- **Target users:** PER-0001 (Relaxed Idle Gamer), PER-0002 (Systems-Driven Strategist), PER-0003 (In-Chat Explorer).
- **Usage context:** Short, frequent sessions on web and in-chat surfaces; optional longer sessions for deeper simulation experimentation.
- **Primary workflows:** Return and recap → choose next upgrade or experiment → observe colony change → share or save progress.

The product narrative is intentionally hybrid: a calm idle loop for casual players paired with optional depth for strategists. This duality is managed through pacing templates and progressive system unlocks, so the experience can scale with player interest without overwhelming early sessions. It also assumes that in-chat surfaces can act as a lightweight, low-friction entry point rather than the sole platform. The web experience remains the anchor for performance-heavy simulation and extended play.

## 2.2 Market and competitive landscape (optional but recommended)
- **Alternatives users choose today:** Mobile idle games and simulation titles with mixed monetization models (E-0002, E-0004).
- **Differentiation thesis:** Combine fair monetization with visible colony evolution and experimental depth; add in-chat continuity to reduce context switching (E-0009).
- **Switching costs and adoption barriers:** Browser distribution lacks built-in reach, so the experience must be compelling immediately and shareable to create viral loops (E-0007).

Competitors in idle simulation often rely on aggressive ads or purchase pressure, which conflicts with the fairness expectations of PER-0001 and PER-0002. The product strategy therefore positions fairness as a core differentiator, supported by ledger transparency, optional cosmetic spend, and explicit no-paywall rules. For PER-0003, the competitive frame is not a direct game competitor but the broader set of in-chat experiences. The novelty and persistence trust signals are therefore essential to keep in-chat explorers engaged.

## 2.3 Strategic alignment
- **Company strategy alignment:** Explore high-upside WebGPU + ChatGPT App distribution while validating fair monetization in idle simulations.
- **Portfolio fit:** Extends simulation portfolio with a relaxed, science-flavored idle loop that can be iterated into deeper strategy play.
- **Ecosystem fit:** Designed to run in web and chat contexts with a shared persistence layer to support cross-surface engagement.

The product strategy leans into “long, stable natural keys” for state and content so that progress is trackable across devices and surfaces. This is consistent with the PHOSPHENE model of traceability: every feature ties back to a proposition, and every proposition is linked to a persona and research evidence. The PRD aims to keep that chain intact so downstream feature-management can trace FRs without reinventing constraints.

## 2.4 Guiding principles (design and engineering)
- Fairness over pressure → Monetization is optional, transparent, and never blocks core progression.
- Short-session respect → Every session should end with visible progress and a clear next step.
- Depth without overload → Systems expand gradually; experimentation tools unlock after early onboarding.
- Persistence trust → State is reliable and user-visible across web and chat contexts.

## 2.5 Distribution posture
The distribution posture is intentionally conservative. Web distribution is treated as the baseline and must succeed on its own, while in-chat distribution is treated as an experimental wedge with separate success metrics. If in-chat adoption underperforms, the product should still be viable as a browser-based idle simulation with strong social share loops. This posture minimizes dependency on any single platform while still allowing upside if ChatGPT Apps gain traction.

## 2.6 Positioning narrative
Positioning centers on “fair progression with scientific delight.” The relaxed idle gamer should feel that progress is earned and calm, not pressured. The strategist should see an opportunity to master a living system that reacts to choices. The in-chat explorer should perceive the game as a conversational companion that respects their context.

This positioning implies a tonal constraint for the entire experience. Store messaging must be gentle and explanatory, not urgent. Narrative beats should emphasize discovery and curiosity rather than competition. Even social features like creator spotlights and community boards should celebrate experiments and discoveries rather than leaderboards that promote pay-to-win optics.

The positioning also defines what the product is not. It is not an aggressive monetization machine; it is not a hyper-competitive strategy title; it is not a one-off toy experience. It is a sustainable, fair, and charming simulation that can grow with the player’s interest. By codifying this narrative in the PRD, the team can evaluate new features against the positioning and avoid drift.

## 3.5 Persona narratives (context for requirements)
PER-0001 expects a calming idle loop that respects time. A short session must still feel meaningful, with a visual payoff and a clear next action. If optional spend appears too frequently or blocks progress, this persona churns quickly, so the PRD treats fairness and pacing as non-negotiable requirements.

PER-0002 is more tolerant of complexity but less tolerant of shallow mechanics. The strategist requires evidence that choices matter, which is why the experiment notebook, benchmark arena, and forecast lens are all prioritized. Performance and transparency are part of the emotional contract; if the simulation feels brittle or opaque, the persona interprets it as illegitimate.

PER-0003 cares most about continuity and conversation. This persona is only retained if the experience can be launched inside chat without friction, and if persistence feels trustworthy enough to return and spend. The in-chat flows are therefore required to include visible sync cues, AI guidance, and transparent receipts.

## 3.6 Proposition clusters (design implications)
The propositions cluster into three experience pillars: fair progression, deep experimentation, and in-chat continuity. Fair progression covers optional monetization, return rituals, and adaptive milestones that keep short sessions satisfying without guilt. Deep experimentation includes benchmark tools and strategy guidance so PER-0002 can treat the colony like a system rather than a toy. In-chat continuity bundles persistence, trusted commerce, and discovery pulses so PER-0003 can stay inside the conversation.

These clusters are intentionally overlapping. For example, the economy ledger supports both fairness (PER-0001) and legitimacy (PER-0002), while in-chat upgrade receipts support both trust (PER-0003) and fairness perceptions (PER-0001). The requirements and feature catalogue reflect this overlap by mapping to multiple personas and propositions whenever a capability serves more than one segment.

## Goals and scope

ID: PRD-001

# 4) Goals, Non-goals, and Scope

## 4.1 Goals (outcome-based)
- G1: Achieve a fair-progress idle loop that keeps PER-0001 engaged through visible short-session gains and transparent monetization. This goal is measured by recap completion and trust scores.
- G2: Provide experiment-grade systems and metrics that allow PER-0002 to test strategies and validate depth. This goal is measured by benchmark usage and repeat experiments.
- G3: Deliver an in-chat experience for PER-0003 with reliable persistence and AI guidance to reduce context switching. This goal is measured by in-chat sync success and return rate.
- G4: Validate monetization viability without aggressive ads or pay-to-win mechanics. This goal is measured by conversion paired with trust scores.

## 4.2 Non-goals (explicit exclusions)
- NG1: Building a full narrative RPG or PvP competitive system. These modes would add complexity before core loop validation.
- NG2: Relying solely on ads or whale-driven monetization. This would conflict with fairness expectations in research.
- NG3: Shipping a polished cross-platform native client in this iteration. The web and chat surfaces are the focus for validation.

## 4.3 In-scope and out-of-scope
| Area | In Scope | Out of Scope | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Idle loop + pacing | ✅ | ❌ | Must serve short sessions and optional depth. |
| WebGPU simulation | ✅ | ❌ | Optimize for modern browsers; iOS limitations tracked. |
| In-chat launcher + persistence | ✅ | ❌ | Prototype-level commerce integration only. |
| Competitive PvP | ❌ | ✅ | Not supported in initial program. |
| Educational licensing | ❌ | ✅ | Out of scope per RA-001. |

## 4.4 Assumptions
- A1: Fair monetization and transparent economy will reduce churn for casual idle players (E-0001, E-0004). This assumption is validated through trust surveys and retention cohorts.
- A2: Strategists will engage if experimentation tools reveal meaningful cause-and-effect (E-0005). This assumption is validated through experiment usage and repeat benchmarks.
- A3: In-chat distribution is an experimental upside but cannot be the sole acquisition channel (E-0007, E-0009). This assumption is validated through channel mix and funnel performance.

These assumptions are intentionally treated as hypotheses that must be validated with telemetry and tests. If the fairness pledge does not lift retention or if strategists do not use the experimentation tools, the scope must shift toward different value propositions. The plan therefore includes instrumentation in Phase 0 to measure return recap use, experiment completion, and purchase trust ratings, so assumptions are either confirmed or falsified quickly.

## 4.5 Dependencies
- D1: Persistence service that supports chat + web sessions. This dependency is a launch gate because it underpins trust.
- D2: WebGPU rendering budget and performance baselines. This dependency protects strategist perception of depth.
- D3: Product-marketing assets (PER-0001/2/3, PROP-0001..0028). This dependency keeps requirements traceable.

## 4.6 Success boundaries
This PRD does not assume a global launch. It focuses on evidence of retention and trust in a controlled cohort. If the product cannot maintain stable sync or demonstrate fair monetization perception, the program should pause before expanding features. These boundaries protect against scaling a weak core loop.

## 4.7 Scope rationale
The scope is intentionally narrow to prevent the team from over-investing in content volume before the core loop is validated. A smaller scope allows the team to test whether the fair-progress loop, return recap, and discovery cadence actually produce the desired retention outcomes. If these core mechanics fail, adding more content would only amplify the failure. This rationale keeps the roadmap honest.

The scope also prioritizes system clarity over narrative depth. While story moments are included to deliver delight, they are scoped as micro-beats rather than full arcs. This ensures that the product can deliver narrative value without committing to a large content production pipeline. The seasonal arc features are therefore treated as Phase 2 expansions, not as prerequisites for launch.

Finally, the scope is designed to be reversible. If the in-chat experience proves unstable, the product can revert to web-only distribution without re-architecting the core loop. If strategists show stronger engagement than casual players, the roadmap can lean into deeper systems without abandoning the fair-progress promise. This flexibility is part of the scope rationale and is essential for maintaining momentum during the validation phase.

## Success metrics

ID: PRD-001

# 5) Success Metrics and Measurement

## 5.1 Metrics framework
Define metrics across: acquisition, activation, engagement, retention, revenue, reliability, cost. Metrics must be aligned to persona outcomes rather than vanity signals; for example, a discovery event is only meaningful if it coincides with a return recap or a short-session completion. Each major feature in the core loop should have at least one primary metric and one guardrail. This ensures that fairness and trust do not regress when monetization experiments run.

## 5.2 North Star metric
- **North Star:** Day-7 returning sessions with a completed “return recap” action.
- **Why it reflects value:** Indicates players are returning, seeing progress, and using the designed short-session loop.
- **Guardrails:** Crash-free sessions, monetization trust score, and opt-in retention sentiment.

## 5.3 KPI definitions
| KPI | Definition | Event Sources | Query Logic | Target | Alert Threshold | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Activation rate | % of new users who complete first colony upgrade | client events | users with `onboarding_complete` / installs | 45% | <30% | PM |
| Return recap completion | % of returning users who open recap and act | client events | `recap_open` + `recap_action` / returning users | 60% | <40% | PM |
| Session delight | % of sessions with a discovery moment | client events | `discovery_unlock` / sessions | 35% | <20% | Design |
| Strategy experiment usage | % of strategists who run an experiment | client events | `experiment_run` / PER-0002 tagged sessions | 25% | <10% | PM |
| In-chat continuity | % of in-chat sessions with sync success | backend logs | `sync_success` / `sync_attempt` | 98% | <95% | Eng |
| Monetization trust | % of users rating monetization “fair” | survey + prompt | `trust_rating >=4` / respondents | 70% | <50% | Research |
| IAP conversion | % of users making optional purchase | commerce events | `purchase_complete` / MAU | 3% | <1% | PM |
| Crash-free session rate | % sessions without crash | crash logs | `crash_free_sessions` / sessions | 99.5% | <98.5% | Eng |

## 5.4 Experimentation plan
- **Hypotheses to validate:** Fair economy reduces churn (E-0001, E-0004); strategy tools increase depth engagement (E-0005); in-chat persistence reduces abandonment (E-0009, E-0010).
- **Experiment types:** A/B pacing of discovery cadence, ledger transparency tests, in-chat persistence prompts.
- **Decision criteria:** Promote features that lift Day-7 retention by ≥10% and do not reduce monetization trust score.

## 5.5 Metric interpretation notes
Metrics should be interpreted through the lens of persona cohorts. A low experiment usage rate is not necessarily a failure if PER-0002 cohort size is small, but it is a failure if strategists adopt and then abandon the tools. Similarly, high IAP conversion is not success if the monetization trust score declines; in that case the product is drifting away from the fairness differentiator. These notes are included to prevent a focus on raw revenue at the expense of long-term retention and trust.

## 5.6 Metric design details
The metric design should distinguish between relaxed, strategist, and in-chat cohorts. Session length, pacing template choice, and feature usage can be used as proxy labels to segment players without self-reporting. This is essential because personas are hypotheses rather than fixed user segments; the metrics should show whether users behave as expected for each persona. For example, if short-session players rarely open the return recap, the fair progression loop is not working as intended.

Metrics should also be interpreted with sequence analysis. A discovery event is meaningful if it occurs after a recap and results in an upgrade, but less meaningful if it occurs during a session that ends in abandonment. Similarly, a purchase is meaningful if it follows a ledger review and does not reduce trust scores. The PRD therefore calls for funnel tracking that includes trust indicators, not just conversion rate.

The system should support cohort retention analysis by feature exposure. If players who see the fairness pledge return more often than those who do not, the pledge is working as a trust mechanism. If players who use the experiment notebook retain longer than those who only use the benchmark arena, the product might prioritize the notebook in messaging. These analyses should feed directly into the roadmap decisions documented in the decision log.

## Requirements

ID: PRD-001

# Requirements

This folder splits requirements into functional vs non-functional.

## Requirement themes (narrative)
The requirements are organized around three pillars: fair progression, deep experimentation, and in-chat continuity. Fair progression protects the relaxed idle gamer from coercive monetization and pacing stalls. Deep experimentation protects the strategist from shallow loops by exposing measurement and comparison tools. In-chat continuity protects the chat-native explorer from losing context and progress.

Fair progression requirements prioritize transparency in the economy. The ledger and fairness pledge are product contract statements that keep retention from collapsing when optional spend appears. Requirements emphasize clear labeling and a no-paywall rule so that players can make low-pressure decisions.

Short-session pacing is a critical theme. The return recap ensures the player sees progress from time away, while adaptive milestones prevent stalling and repetitive grind. These requirements are treated as part of the core loop rather than optional “nice to have” features.

Discovery and novelty requirements maintain delight. The product must supply visual and narrative payoffs that make the colony feel alive, otherwise the loop becomes a series of numbers with no emotion. The discovery cadence requirements specify how often novelty should appear and require telemetry to confirm that it is happening.

Deep experimentation requirements are anchored in the strategist persona. The experiment notebook, benchmark arena, and forecast lens establish a framework for testing hypotheses about colony behavior. Without these tools, strategists will perceive the simulation as shallow even if the underlying system is complex.

In-chat continuity requirements exist because the in-chat experience is fragile. Any loss of state or inconsistent store behavior undermines trust quickly. Requirements like the trust vault and cross-surface handshake are elevated to P0 priority to keep continuity visible.

Non-functional requirements are framed as product requirements, not engineering constraints. Performance thresholds are set based on persona expectations, and sync SLOs are treated as trust signals. This ensures that reliability is part of the product promise.

Traceability is a requirement principle. Each requirement is linked to personas and propositions so the team can identify which user need is addressed. This keeps downstream feature work grounded in research.

ID: PRD-001

# 6) Requirements — functional

## 6.1 Requirement conventions
- **Requirement IDs:** R-CORE-001, R-SPEC-041, etc.
- **Modality:** shall/should/may

## 6.1a Requirement rationale
Functional requirements are grouped to protect fairness, pacing, experimentation, and in-chat continuity. The PRD treats these as user promises rather than implementation details. Each requirement should be traceable to a proposition and persona so that the team can validate whether the experience is delivering on its stated value. This rationale section exists to prevent requirements from becoming a list of features without purpose.

Requirements connected to fairness and monetization are elevated to P0 because they address the most explicit pain signal in research. The fair progress loop, economy ledger, and no-paywall rule all reinforce trust that optional spend will not distort core progression. When these are missing or poorly executed, the loop feels manipulative and short-session retention declines. Therefore, requirements in this category demand visible cues and measurable behaviors, not just hidden backend logic.

Pacing and discovery requirements are the second-most critical because they determine whether a player returns after the first session. The return recap is both a narrative and operational device: it reminds players that time away is rewarded rather than punished. Adaptive milestones and discovery cadence ensure that the loop does not collapse into repetition. These requirements should be tested for both immediate delight and long-term sustainability, since too much novelty can become noise.

Experimentation requirements are framed as user-facing research tools for PER-0002. The experiment notebook and benchmark arena are not just gamified features; they are how strategists learn whether the simulation is deep enough to invest time. If these tools are shallow or inconsistent, the strategist persona will interpret the game as superficial. Therefore, experiment requirements include explicit comparison outputs and performance metrics to ensure the results feel credible.

In-chat continuity requirements address the fragile nature of chat-native experiences. Any loss of state or inconsistent store behavior undermines trust quickly. For this persona, even a small inconsistency is a major break in immersion. Requirements like the trust vault, receipt archive, and cross-surface handshake are included to make continuity visible and verifiable.

Finally, growth and social requirements are prioritized after the trust and pacing pillars are satisfied. Social proof and creator spotlights can boost acquisition, but they must not degrade the calm, fair experience. If they add pressure or clutter, they will hurt retention. These requirements are therefore lower priority and are expected to be tuned carefully based on cohort data.

# 6) Requirements — non-functional

Define measurable thresholds and verification methods.

## Non-functional rationale
Non-functional requirements are framed as trust requirements, not just engineering targets. If performance or reliability fails, the core proposition of a credible, fair simulation collapses. These requirements therefore apply to both web and in-chat contexts, even when the in-chat surface has lighter UI. The thresholds are meant to ensure that short sessions feel crisp, strategists trust the simulation, and in-chat explorers believe persistence is real.

The performance requirements are particularly important for the strategist persona. A low frame rate signals that the simulation is thin or unreliable. Similarly, long load times undermine the short-session promise to relaxed players. By codifying these thresholds, the PRD ensures that performance is treated as a feature rather than a technical afterthought.

Reliability requirements focus on persistence because state loss is catastrophic for trust. The sync success rate and crash-free session targets are therefore treated as launch gates. If those metrics regress, the product must pause growth features until stability is restored. This aligns with the trust-first philosophy of the PRD.

## Performance and latency
| NFR ID | Scenario | Threshold | Measurement Method | Environment | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| NFR-PERF-001 | WebGPU frame rendering under load | p95 <= 40ms | FPS sampling + frame timing | mid-tier laptop | Enables strategist trust (PER-0002). |
| NFR-PERF-002 | First interactive load (web) | <= 6s | RUM timing | global | Must support short sessions. |
| NFR-PERF-003 | Chat session launch | <= 3s | chat launch telemetry | chat surface | Aligns with PER-0003 entry expectations. |

## Availability and resilience
| NFR ID | SLO | Target | Error Budget Policy | Degradation Modes | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| NFR-REL-001 | Sync success rate | 98% | Alert if <95% weekly | read-only fallback | Protects persistence trust. |
| NFR-REL-002 | Crash-free sessions | 99.5% | Alert if <98.5% weekly | safe mode | Critical for retention. |

## Privacy and data handling
| NFR ID | Scenario | Threshold | Measurement Method | Environment | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| NFR-PRIV-001 | Data handling disclosure | 100% of sessions show privacy summary on request | QA checklist | all | Aligns with PROP-0023 trust requirements. |

## Feature catalogue

ID: PRD-001

# Feature catalogue

Split into core vs special features.

## Feature taxonomy rationale
Core features represent the minimum set required to satisfy the three persona pillars. They include fairness, return recaps, experimentation tools, and in-chat continuity. Without these, the product would not meet the promises encoded in the propositions, so they are prioritized as P0–P1 features. Special features are value-add elements that enhance delight or growth but can be delayed without breaking the core experience.

The catalogue is intentionally redundant across personas. For example, the fair progress hub serves both relaxed and in-chat personas, while the experimentation studio serves strategists and provides analytics signals for product managers. This redundancy is a deliberate design choice: it ensures that each feature is accountable to multiple personas, reducing the chance that a feature becomes orphaned from actual user needs.

## Feature sequencing notes
Feature sequencing is driven by validation learning, not by aesthetic polish. The return recap loop and fairness hub ship first because they validate whether the core loop is trustworthy. Experimentation tools ship next because they test whether strategists perceive depth. In-chat continuity follows once persistence stability is proven in the web baseline.

## Feature-to-requirement alignment
Every feature in this catalogue maps to explicit requirements and propositions. This alignment ensures that the feature catalogue can be decomposed into feature requests (FRs) without losing traceability. If a new feature is proposed, it must either map to an existing proposition or trigger an upstream change in product-marketing or research.

## Quality thresholds
Core features must meet the non-functional requirements for performance and reliability before they can be marked complete. Special features can be shipped behind feature flags if their performance impact is minimal. The product team should avoid shipping special features that undermine fairness or increase cognitive load.

## Deprecation and iteration guidance
If a feature underperforms, the team should first look at the persona and proposition it supports before removing it. For example, if discovery pulses are underused, the team should test cadence changes and narrative framing before retiring the feature. This avoids over-reacting to early data and keeps the product aligned with the research hypotheses.

## Architecture

ID: PRD-001

# 8) Architecture and Technical Design

## 8.1 Architecture overview
- **Architecture style:** Client-heavy simulation with authoritative persistence service.
- **Primary runtime model:** WebGPU simulation loop with deterministic snapshots for benchmark and replay.
- **Core boundaries:**
  - Client simulation + rendering
  - Persistence + sync service
  - Experiment/benchmark service
  - Commerce + telemetry pipeline

The architecture must support two pacing modes without branching the codebase. The client should run a unified simulation loop while exposing configuration layers for relaxed and strategist play. Persistence must be durable and verifiable so the trust vault can display explicit confirmations of state saves. This also means that any in-chat surface must be able to render a summary without requiring the full heavy simulation to boot.

## 8.2 Key flows
- **Return recap flow:** client pulls last snapshot → computes delta → displays recap → writes new snapshot.
- **Experiment flow:** client clones snapshot → runs simulation parameters → logs metrics → writes experiment log.
- **In-chat continuity flow:** chat session token → sync service → state hash validation → UI indicator update.

Each flow is instrumented so product analytics can trace outcomes back to propositions. For example, the return recap flow is the core of PROP-0002 and PROP-0015, and must include telemetry that measures recap engagement and resulting actions. The experiment flow underpins PROP-0016 and PROP-0020, and therefore must include benchmark scoring outputs and parameter capture so strategists can verify the effect of their choices.

## 8.3 Component responsibilities
- **Simulation engine:** Runs deterministic colony behavior, exposes hooks for discovery events, and emits progression metrics.
- **Recap generator:** Computes deltas, summarizes progress, and selects the next best action based on pacing templates.
- **Experiment runner:** Allows branching snapshots, applies parameter overrides, and records outputs for comparison.
- **Sync service:** Stores snapshots, verifies state hashes, and resolves conflicts across devices.
- **Commerce bridge:** Handles optional purchases and receipts without blocking core progression.

These components should be built so they can fail gracefully. If the experiment runner is unavailable, the simulation still needs to run for relaxed players. If the sync service is down, the client should enter read-only mode and inform the player rather than silently losing progress. These failure behaviors are part of the trust contract and are therefore product requirements, not optional engineering decisions.

## 8.4 Data flow and observability
The data flow starts with the simulation engine emitting state updates and milestone events. These events are summarized into a lightweight snapshot that includes economy deltas, discovery moments, and progress toward milestones. The snapshot is stored through the sync service and becomes the source for return recaps, trust vault entries, and experiment baselines. This approach keeps the client responsive while ensuring that every key event is traceable.

Observability should be built into each flow. The system should emit telemetry for recap views, discovery unlocks, benchmark runs, and in-chat launches. Each event should be tagged with pacing template and surface (web or chat) so product analytics can track persona-aligned behaviors. If telemetry is missing, the product team will be unable to validate the core hypotheses, which is why observability is treated as a first-class architecture requirement.

The architecture must also support content scheduling without disrupting core simulation. Discovery events and seasonal arcs should be delivered as content payloads that can be updated without full client redeploys. This allows the product to tune novelty cadence while keeping the simulation engine stable. It also ensures that content experiments can be run safely without compromising core fairness or performance.

## Platform and technology

ID: PRD-001

# 9) Platform Selection and Technology Standards

## 9.1 Selection criteria
- Performance on mid-tier laptops and modern mobile browsers.
- Compatibility with ChatGPT in-chat surface requirements.
- Ability to support deterministic simulation snapshots.

The platform decisions prioritize consistency over maximal reach. The user promise is that the colony feels alive and responsive; any platform that undermines this promise should be excluded from early phases. This is especially critical for PER-0002, who interprets poor performance as shallow design. Therefore, a stable WebGPU pipeline and reliable state persistence are non-negotiable even if they limit initial device coverage.

## 9.2 Platform choices (with rationale)
- **WebGPU + WebAssembly:** Required for credible simulation depth (supports PER-0002 expectations).
- **Server-side persistence service:** Needed for cross-surface continuity (PROP-0008, PROP-0023).
- **Event telemetry pipeline:** Supports fairness and retention measurement.

## 9.3 Known constraints
- WebGPU coverage on iOS may be limited; plan for graceful fallback (lite mode).
- ChatGPT commerce integration is still evolving; the purchase flow must be resilient to changing APIs (E-0010).

## 9.4 Technology standards
- Use deterministic simulation steps to ensure benchmark and experiment reproducibility.
- Ensure all user-facing economic values can be audited in the economy ledger.
- Maintain strict separation between optional purchases and core progression logic.

## Data, integrations, and APIs

ID: PRD-001

# 10) Data, Integrations, and APIs

## 10.1 Data model overview
- **Colony state:** Snapshot model with delta history for recaps and experiments. The snapshot must include milestone and discovery fields.
- **Economy ledger:** Baseline vs boosted progression values for fairness transparency. The ledger must support drill-down comparisons.
- **Experiment logs:** Scenario parameters, metrics, and outcomes. The logs must support repeatable benchmarks.

The data model must support rapid synthesis into player-facing summaries. Each snapshot should include explicit fields for discovery events, milestone progress, and economy changes so the recap generator can produce a high-quality narrative without re-running the simulation. This design ensures that return recaps remain fast even on slower devices and in chat contexts.

## 10.2 Integrations
- **ChatGPT App surface:** Embed interactive UI; support commerce protocol when available (E-0010). The integration must preserve conversational context.
- **Telemetry pipeline:** Events for recap, discovery, purchases, and experiments. The pipeline must tag surface and pacing template.

The telemetry design should allow segmentation by persona proxies (session length, feature usage, and pacing template) so the PM team can map behavior to PER-0001/2/3 without explicit self-reporting. This segmentation is essential for evaluating whether the product is meeting persona-specific expectations. The commerce integration should also expose clear receipt data so that trust vault entries can be shown to PER-0003.

## 10.3 Data retention
- Keep minimal personal data; focus on session and colony state identifiers. This supports a trust-first privacy posture.
- Retain experiment logs long enough to support comparison across sessions. This supports strategist credibility.
- Provide a clear data deletion path to maintain trust. This supports compliance and transparency.

## 10.4 Data governance and analytics notes
Data governance must align with the fairness narrative. Players should feel confident that the game is not extracting unnecessary data, so only events needed for progression, trust, and experimentation should be stored. Any additional telemetry should be justified in the decision log and described in the privacy summary. This reduces the risk that data collection undermines trust, especially for in-chat explorers.

Analytics should emphasize sequence analysis rather than isolated event counts. For example, a ledger view followed by a purchase suggests an informed choice, while a purchase without a ledger view may suggest confusion or pressure. Similarly, a discovery pulse that leads to a recap action suggests successful pacing, while a pulse that leads to a session exit suggests overload. These analytics patterns should guide iteration decisions.

The data model should also support experimental toggles. When a feature variant is active, the event stream should record variant IDs so that outcomes can be attributed accurately. This is critical for evaluating whether changes to pacing, discovery cadence, or in-chat prompts are improving or harming the experience. Without this, the team would be unable to validate the hypotheses embedded in the PRD.

## Security, privacy, and compliance

ID: PRD-001

# 11) Security, Privacy, and Compliance

## 11.1 Data classification and handling
- **Colony state:** Pseudonymous gameplay data; must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Purchase metadata:** Store receipts and transaction IDs with audit trail.

## 11.2 Privacy requirements
- Provide a clear data handling summary on request (R-SPEC-057).
- Allow players to export or delete account-associated colony state.

Privacy is a trust lever for PER-0003 and PER-0001. If players do not understand where their progress is stored or how it is used, they will not return or spend. This is why the PRD treats data disclosure as part of the product experience rather than a legal afterthought. The trust vault and economy ledger interfaces should link directly to the underlying data policies to close the trust loop.

## 11.3 Risk controls
- Validate persistence integrity via state hashes (PROP-0023).
- Rate-limit commerce endpoints to prevent abuse.
- Use anomaly detection to flag unusually high spend patterns that could indicate coercive designs.

## 11.4 Compliance and trust UX
Compliance workflows should be visible but not disruptive. When a player requests data deletion, the system should provide a clear timeline and confirm when the deletion is complete. If purchases are reversed, the system should explain the impact on colony state so that the player understands the consequences.

Trust UX should be consistent across web and chat. If a privacy summary is available in web settings, the same summary should be accessible in chat with the same language. This consistency reduces confusion and reinforces that the product operates under the same fairness principles regardless of surface. It also protects against the perception that chat is an experimental environment with weaker safeguards.

## UX, content, and accessibility

ID: PRD-001

# 12) UX, Content, and Accessibility

## 12.1 UX principles and constraints
- Every screen should answer: “What changed?” and “What’s the next best action?”
- Avoid clutter early; progressive disclosure for strategist tools.

The experience should feel calm and transparent. Players should never wonder whether a change came from real progress or from a monetization mechanic. The UI should therefore surface clear labels for optional purchases and highlight the impact of those purchases on colony state. This transparency is central to maintaining trust with PER-0001 and PER-0002.

## 12.2 Content plan
- Discovery moments include short, charming captions and optional science facts.
- Story moments connect progress to ant colony behaviors (PROP-0007, PROP-0022).

Content must be lightweight enough to fit short sessions while still offering novelty. Each discovery moment should include a one-sentence summary and an optional “learn more” expansion for curious players. This keeps PER-0001 engaged without overwhelming them, while giving PER-0002 the depth they seek. For PER-0003, content should be framed as chat-friendly snippets that can be shared without losing context.

## 12.3 Accessibility
- Provide adjustable text sizes, contrast, and a calm mode (R-SPEC-053, R-CORE-008).

Accessibility features should be discoverable in onboarding and re-surface when players enable quiet or comfort modes. This ensures that adjustments are not hidden in settings and that players who need them can immediately find relief. These adjustments also support the relaxed tone of the game and reinforce the fairness narrative by showing care for player comfort.

## 12.4 Scenario walkthroughs
**Scenario A: Short-session return (PER-0001).** The player opens the game after a day away and immediately sees a return recap card. The recap highlights food gathered, a new tunnel unlocked, and a suggested upgrade with a clear explanation of why it matters. The player taps the upgrade, sees a short discovery animation, and exits within two minutes feeling satisfied. This scenario validates the short-session promise and is the baseline for measuring recap effectiveness.

**Scenario B: Experiment session (PER-0002).** The strategist launches a benchmark arena, selects two colony snapshots, and runs a comparison. The system provides a scorecard with efficiency deltas and a short commentary on which lever drove the change. The strategist then opens the experiment notebook and logs a new hypothesis for the next run. This scenario validates that the simulation feels measurable and that the tooling encourages deeper play.

**Scenario C: In-chat return (PER-0003).** The player returns to a chat thread and sees a continuity indicator confirming the colony is synced. A short discovery pulse appears with a shareable moment, and an AI prompt offers a brief explanation of the new behavior. The player accepts a small optional upgrade in-chat and receives an immediate receipt with rollback instructions. This scenario validates that continuity and commerce feel trustworthy in a conversational context.

## Delivery plan and roadmap

ID: PRD-001

# 13) Delivery Plan and Roadmap

## 13.1 Program structure
- **Phase 0 (Prototype):** Core loop, recap, fairness pledge, basic persistence. This phase proves the loop without heavy content.
- **Phase 1 (Validation):** Discovery cadence, economy ledger, in-chat launch, experiment notebook. This phase tests depth and trust hypotheses.
- **Phase 2 (Expansion):** Benchmark arena, strategy compass, seasonal arcs, creator spotlights. This phase scales once trust is confirmed.

Phase sequencing is driven by evidence needs rather than feature ambition. Phase 0 validates that the core loop is engaging without monetization pressure, while Phase 1 tests whether deeper experimentation and in-chat continuity can move retention and conversion metrics. Phase 2 adds growth and novelty features only after trust signals are established.

## 13.2 Dependencies
- ChatGPT in-chat integration readiness (E-0010) and web distribution plan (E-0007). These dependencies determine how quickly in-chat features can scale.

## 13.3 Milestone definitions
- **M0:** Fairness pledge, recap loop, and sync service operating with baseline telemetry. This milestone requires clean data pipelines.
- **M1:** Economy ledger and discovery cadence active with at least one experiment tool. This milestone requires measurable cohort behavior.
- **M2:** Benchmark arena and strategy compass in place, with seasonal arc content live. This milestone requires stable performance and trust metrics.

Each milestone requires measurable thresholds rather than just feature completion. For example, M0 is not complete unless return recap completion exceeds 40% and sync success exceeds 95%. This ensures that milestones reflect product viability, not just engineering progress.

## 13.4 Phase detail
Phase 0 is focused on validating the short-session promise. The return recap, fairness pledge, and core pacing template must be tested with a small cohort to ensure that players feel progress within their first two sessions. The phase also includes baseline telemetry so that subsequent phases can compare against a stable control.

Phase 1 is where the product confronts its biggest hypotheses. The economy ledger must show whether transparency reduces churn, and the experiment notebook must show whether strategists engage when given structured tools. In-chat launch is included here because it depends on persistence reliability; if sync failures are high, the in-chat beta should be delayed. The goal of Phase 1 is to collect enough evidence to decide whether the product can sustain both casual and strategist personas.

Phase 2 adds growth and novelty features, but only after trust and depth are proven. Seasonal arcs and creator spotlights should be used to broaden the acquisition funnel, while benchmark tools deepen engagement. If any trust metrics regress during Phase 2, growth features should be paused to protect the core loop.

## Testing and quality strategy

ID: PRD-001

# 14) Testing and Quality Strategy

## 14.1 Test pyramid and scope
- Unit tests for simulation rules and economy ledger calculations. These tests validate deterministic outcomes and fairness constraints.
- Integration tests for sync, purchase flows, and chat launch. These tests validate continuity and commerce trust.
- End-to-end tests for onboarding → return recap → upgrade purchase. These tests validate the full short-session loop.

Quality criteria align with trust requirements. Any regression that affects persistence, purchase receipts, or fairness visibility should be treated as a severity-one issue, since it directly impacts monetization trust and retention. Performance tests should focus on mid-tier hardware to ensure the simulation does not degrade for the strategist persona.

## 14.2 Validation experiments
- Fairness pledge A/B test vs control for retention impact. The test should isolate messaging from economy changes.
- In-chat continuity test for session return rate. The test should compare synced and non-synced cohorts.
- Strategy benchmark feature test for PER-0002 engagement. The test should track repeat benchmark runs.

Experiments must be structured to avoid confounding variables. For example, when testing the fairness pledge, the economy ledger should remain constant so that any retention lift can be attributed to messaging rather than to actual progression changes. When testing in-chat continuity, the web experience should remain stable to detect whether chat itself is the driver of return behavior.

## 14.3 Test coverage intent
Test coverage should mirror the persona pillars. Fairness-related flows should have deterministic tests for edge cases, such as ensuring that optional spend does not unlock a blocked progression gate. Continuity flows should have simulated network failures to confirm that the trust vault still reports accurate status. Experimentation flows should have regression tests that verify benchmark scoring against known simulation outputs.

The testing strategy should also include observational QA for narrative tone. Story moments and discovery captions should be reviewed to ensure they reinforce calm, fair progression rather than high-pressure messaging. This qualitative check is important because tone shifts can indirectly influence the perception of fairness and trust.

## Operations and support model

ID: PRD-001

# 15) Operations and Support Model

## 15.1 Operational posture
- Live ops cadence for discovery content and seasonal arcs.
- Incident response for sync failures and commerce errors.

Operational processes must prioritize trust events. If sync fails, the system must proactively notify players and provide a clear recovery plan. For commerce issues, receipts and rollback instructions should be immediately available through the trust vault. These processes reduce support tickets while reinforcing fairness and transparency.

## 15.2 Support tooling
- Trust vault audit log for customer support troubleshooting.
- Content feedback intake for repetition flags.

Support teams should have a dashboard that maps issues to propositions and personas. For example, a spike in “lost progress” tickets would directly threaten PROP-0023 and PER-0003, while a spike in “ads too aggressive” feedback would threaten PROP-0001 and PER-0001. This mapping keeps operations aligned with product strategy rather than reacting to symptoms alone.

## 15.3 Support playbooks
A “lost progress” playbook should instruct support to validate the trust vault log, confirm last successful sync time, and offer a recovery path. The response should be empathetic and include a clear summary of what happened to reinforce trust. A separate “purchase confusion” playbook should guide support to surface receipts, explain optional spend labels, and provide refunds when necessary. These playbooks keep the support experience consistent with the fairness proposition.

Content fatigue playbooks should focus on adjusting discovery cadence rather than blaming user behavior. If a cohort reports repetitive sessions, the content team should review discovery scheduling and seasonal arcs, then release a tuned cadence patch. This ensures that operations responds by improving the experience rather than by adding pressure tactics.

## Risks, dependencies, and assumptions

ID: PRD-001

# 16) Risks, Dependencies, and Assumptions

## 16.1 Risk register
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Exposure | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| In-chat distribution underperforms | M | H | H | Treat chat as experiment; maintain web fallback (E-0007, E-0009). | | Open |
| Monetization perceived as coercive | M | H | H | Fairness pledge, ledger transparency, no-paywall rule. | | Open |
| Simulation depth insufficient for strategists | M | H | H | Benchmark arena + experiment tools; validate with PER-0002 cohort. | | Open |
| WebGPU performance variability | M | M | M | Lite mode + performance telemetry (NFR-PERF-001). | | Open |
| Persistence trust erosion | L | H | M | Trust vault logs and sync indicators (PROP-0023). | | Open |

## 16.2 Assumption tracking
Each assumption in Section 4.4 is tracked with explicit evidence requirements. If we cannot validate fair monetization within the first two sprints, we should pause additional feature investment and re-evaluate the economy. If strategists do not use experiment tools at expected rates, we should revisit the depth roadmap before adding growth features.

## 16.3 Dependency posture
Dependencies are ranked by their impact on trust. The persistence service and commerce bridge are the highest-risk dependencies because failures directly undermine the propositions tied to trust and fairness. The architecture and test plan therefore prioritize these components with dedicated monitoring and rollback strategies.

## 16.4 Risk narratives
The primary risk is erosion of trust. A single incident of lost progress or an unclear purchase receipt can invalidate the fairness and continuity narrative. This risk is mitigated by making trust signals visible and by prioritizing reliability in the release gates.

A second risk is misalignment between personas. If the product leans too heavily into strategist tools, relaxed players may churn; if it leans too heavily into casual pacing, strategists may dismiss the simulation. The pacing templates and progressive unlocks are the mitigation here, but they require careful tuning through experiments.

Finally, distribution risk is structural. Web distribution lacks a built-in audience, and in-chat distribution is experimental. The product therefore requires strong sharing mechanisms and creator spotlight features, but these must be deployed only after the core loop is validated to avoid masking retention issues.

## Release readiness and launch plan

ID: PRD-001

# 17) Release Readiness and Launch Plan

## 17.1 Launch strategy
- Soft-launch to web with opt-in in-chat beta.
- Focus on cohorts aligned to PER-0001 and PER-0002 first; expand to PER-0003 after persistence validation.

## 17.2 Readiness checklist
- Fairness pledge and economy ledger implemented.
- Return recap and discovery cadence functioning.
- Sync success rate >= 98% with audit log.
- Crash-free sessions >= 99.5%.

## 17.3 Launch gating criteria
Launch is gated on trust metrics, not just feature completeness. If monetization trust scores are below threshold, the product should not expand into broader distribution. If sync success is below threshold, the in-chat beta should be paused until the trust vault shows stable performance. These criteria ensure that the launch protects the brand promise of fairness and continuity.

## 17.4 Early launch monitoring
During the first two weeks, the team should review daily retention and trust metrics. Any sharp decline should trigger a rollback of the most recent content or feature release. This monitoring ensures that experiments do not erode the core loop or confuse the personas the product is designed to serve.

## Appendix

ID: PRD-001

# Appendix

This folder holds glossary, decision log, open questions, and traceability.

## Appendix usage guidance
The appendix provides the traceability backbone for the PRD. It exists so that future domain work can validate that each requirement still ties back to a proposition and persona. When feature-management and test-management artifacts are created, they should use the appendix to confirm that scope changes are intentional and grounded.

The decision log is not a journal of all activity. It is reserved for decisions that change the direction of the PRD, such as re-prioritizing the fair progress hub or altering the in-chat distribution strategy. This keeps the log lightweight and useful, while still providing a record of why the product moved in a particular direction.

The open questions table is a living list. Questions should be closed only when validated by data or a formal decision; they should not be closed because the team feels confident. This prevents the product from drifting away from evidence-based validation, especially in areas where research confidence is low.

The glossary is critical for cross-domain alignment. Terms like “return recap” or “trust vault” must mean the same thing across product management, feature management, and testing. If a term evolves, it should be updated here first, then propagated to downstream artifacts.

## Extended rationale notes
The appendix exists to preserve continuity across domains, not to store redundant narrative. It should record the reasoning behind requirements so that feature decompositions remain grounded in the same constraints. This is especially important in a product where trust and fairness are central, because those values are easy to erode when features are added in isolation.

When new feature requests are created, the traceability matrix should be consulted before writing any new requirements. This ensures that the feature aligns to an existing proposition or triggers a deliberate upstream change. It also prevents the product-management domain from becoming a dumping ground for unvalidated ideas that bypass research.

Decision log entries should prioritize clarity over completeness. A short entry explaining why a fairness pledge was moved earlier in the roadmap is more valuable than a long entry describing implementation details. Implementation details belong in engineering notes, not in the PRD appendix.

Open questions should be treated as active hypotheses. If an experiment resolves a question, the closure should include a brief summary of the evidence. This practice prevents the team from treating unresolved risks as settled facts and encourages a culture of validation.

The glossary should be updated whenever terminology shifts. For example, if the team decides to rename the “trust vault” to “continuity ledger,” the glossary should change first so that downstream documents remain consistent. This prevents confusion and reduces rework in later domains.

Traceability should be enforced during reviews. If a feature request cannot be traced back to a proposition and persona, it should be paused until the connection is made. This gate protects the product from drifting away from the original problem statement.

## Alignment taxonomy
Alignment reviews should be classified into governance, trust, and pacing tracks. Governance reviews focus on ID integrity, versioning, and dependency headers; trust reviews focus on continuity signals, receipt clarity, and fairness safeguards; pacing reviews focus on cadence, milestone spacing, and return-loop clarity. These tracks allow reviews to be scoped without losing cross-domain accountability.

Experiment reviews should map hypotheses to evidence types: behavioral telemetry, qualitative feedback, and operational incidents. A single metric spike is insufficient; the review should seek convergence across at least two evidence types. This approach preserves rigor without requiring perfect data.

Scope reviews should categorize changes as additive, substitutive, or disruptive. Additive changes extend existing propositions, substitutive changes replace a requirement with an equivalent, and disruptive changes require an updated decision log and traceability matrix. Using this taxonomy keeps scope growth explicit and auditable.

Consistency reviews should verify that terminology, metric names, and event tags remain stable across artifacts. If terminology drifts, update the glossary and propagate the change immediately. This avoids subtle mismatches that can erode automated validation and human understanding.

Governance notes should be written in operational language rather than aspirational prose. Clear, checkable statements reduce ambiguity and improve downstream execution. This supports the PRD’s role as a contract rather than a vision statement.

ID: PRD-001

# 18) Appendix — glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Fairness pledge | A clear statement that optional spending never blocks core progression. |
| Return recap | A summary of offline progress and next best action when a player returns. |
| Trust vault | Audit log of persistence events with visibility for players. |
| Benchmark arena | A mode where strategists compare two colony builds under the same scenario. |

## Extended terminology notes
The PRD references a vocabulary that spans simulation science, game economy design, and chat-native interface conventions. Terms like myrmecology, stigmergy, trophallaxis, and pheromone gradient are used to describe ant behaviors that can inspire discovery moments. This vocabulary supports content variety without requiring heavy narrative arcs.

Economic terms such as sink, faucet, scarcity loop, and pacing curve are used to describe how resources flow through the colony economy. These terms should be interpreted in the context of fairness: a sink should never be a paywall, and a faucet should never be tuned to coerce spending. When these terms appear in feature descriptions, they should be tied back to the economy ledger and trust metrics.

Experimentation terms such as baseline, delta, control, and variance refer to the strategist toolset. The benchmark arena uses these terms to describe comparisons between colony builds, while the experiment notebook logs parameter changes and outcomes. Consistent use of these terms ensures that strategists feel the tools are serious rather than gimmicky.

Observability terms such as telemetry, sampling, anomaly detection, and trace ID describe the measurement system that underpins validation. These terms exist so that requirements can be verified without ambiguity. When a metric is defined in the success section, it should map to a specific telemetry event and a clear query logic.

Chat interface terms such as conversational trail, in-thread pulse, and continuity indicator describe the mechanisms that keep the in-chat experience coherent. These terms should not be conflated with notifications or push messaging; they are designed to be subtle and context-preserving. The glossary ensures that new contributors use the same phrasing when describing these patterns.

Performance terms such as frame budget, render tick, and simulation step describe the runtime constraints of WebGPU and WebAssembly. These terms are used to keep the strategist experience credible; if performance terminology is ignored, the simulation may appear shallow or unstable. The glossary reinforces that performance is part of the user promise, not an implementation detail.

Trust terms such as receipt archive, rollback policy, and persistence checksum describe the explicit evidence shown to players. These terms should appear in UX copy and support playbooks so that the player sees consistent language. The goal is to reduce uncertainty and to make continuity feel tangible rather than abstract.

Accessibility terms such as comfort layer, calm mode, and readability band describe the UX features that lower cognitive load. These terms should be used consistently in the UI so that players can discover them without hunting in settings. The glossary maintains a consistent tone that aligns with the relaxed persona.

Governance terms such as data minimization, retention window, and privacy summary relate to how the product handles player data. These terms support transparency and compliance without adding heavy legal language. They should be used in the privacy summary so that players can understand data handling in plain terms.

Roadmap terms such as phase gate, milestone threshold, and validation sprint indicate that the product is evidence-driven. These terms describe how the team decides whether to proceed or pivot. The glossary makes it explicit that feature delivery is not a substitute for validated outcomes.
