# 13) Delivery Plan and Roadmap

## 13.1 Program structure
- **Phase 0 (Prototype):** Core loop, recap, fairness pledge, basic persistence. This phase proves the loop without heavy content.
- **Phase 1 (Validation):** Discovery cadence, economy ledger, in-chat launch, experiment notebook. This phase tests depth and trust hypotheses.
- **Phase 2 (Expansion):** Benchmark arena, strategy compass, seasonal arcs, creator spotlights. This phase scales once trust is confirmed.

Phase sequencing is driven by evidence needs rather than feature ambition. Phase 0 validates that the core loop is engaging without monetization pressure, while Phase 1 tests whether deeper experimentation and in-chat continuity can move retention and conversion metrics. Phase 2 adds growth and novelty features only after trust signals are established.

## 13.2 Dependencies
- ChatGPT in-chat integration readiness (E-0010) and web distribution plan (E-0007). These dependencies determine how quickly in-chat features can scale.

## 13.3 Milestone definitions
- **M0:** Fairness pledge, recap loop, and sync service operating with baseline telemetry. This milestone requires clean data pipelines.
- **M1:** Economy ledger and discovery cadence active with at least one experiment tool. This milestone requires measurable cohort behavior.
- **M2:** Benchmark arena and strategy compass in place, with seasonal arc content live. This milestone requires stable performance and trust metrics.

Each milestone requires measurable thresholds rather than just feature completion. For example, M0 is not complete unless return recap completion exceeds 40% and sync success exceeds 95%. This ensures that milestones reflect product viability, not just engineering progress.

## 13.4 Phase detail
Phase 0 is focused on validating the short-session promise. The return recap, fairness pledge, and core pacing template must be tested with a small cohort to ensure that players feel progress within their first two sessions. The phase also includes baseline telemetry so that subsequent phases can compare against a stable control.

Phase 1 is where the product confronts its biggest hypotheses. The economy ledger must show whether transparency reduces churn, and the experiment notebook must show whether strategists engage when given structured tools. In-chat launch is included here because it depends on persistence reliability; if sync failures are high, the in-chat beta should be delayed. The goal of Phase 1 is to collect enough evidence to decide whether the product can sustain both casual and strategist personas.

Phase 2 adds growth and novelty features, but only after trust and depth are proven. Seasonal arcs and creator spotlights should be used to broaden the acquisition funnel, while benchmark tools deepen engagement. If any trust metrics regress during Phase 2, growth features should be paused to protect the core loop.
