# 17) Release Readiness and Launch Plan

## 17.1 Launch strategy
- Soft-launch to web with opt-in in-chat beta.
- Focus on cohorts aligned to PER-0001 and PER-0002 first; expand to PER-0003 after persistence validation.

## 17.2 Readiness checklist
- Fairness pledge and economy ledger implemented.
- Return recap and discovery cadence functioning.
- Sync success rate >= 98% with audit log.
- Crash-free sessions >= 99.5%.

## 17.3 Launch gating criteria
Launch is gated on trust metrics, not just feature completeness. If monetization trust scores are below threshold, the product should not expand into broader distribution. If sync success is below threshold, the in-chat beta should be paused until the trust vault shows stable performance. These criteria ensure that the launch protects the brand promise of fairness and continuity.

## 17.4 Early launch monitoring
During the first two weeks, the team should review daily retention and trust metrics. Any sharp decline should trigger a rollback of the most recent content or feature release. This monitoring ensures that experiments do not erode the core loop or confuse the personas the product is designed to serve.
