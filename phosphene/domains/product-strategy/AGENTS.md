# AGENTS.md (domain stub) — <product-strategy>

Primary domain: `<product-strategy>`

This domain uses the canonical PHOSPHENE handoff at `phosphene/AGENTS.md`.

## What you produce

- `product-roadmap` artifacts (bets; Now/Next/Later; constraints)

## Operating boundary

- Use the `<product-strategy>` tag to indicate scope/boundaries in handoffs.
- Avoid “go to this directory” pointers inside handoff/spec docs; those can hijack an agent early.
- Artifacts for this domain live in canonical `output/`, `scripts/`, and `signals/` areas within the repo.

## In-doc script hints (`[V-SCRIPT]`)

Some artifacts include fenced code blocks that begin with `[V-SCRIPT]:`.
Search for `[V-SCRIPT]` to quickly discover relevant control scripts for the nearby section.
