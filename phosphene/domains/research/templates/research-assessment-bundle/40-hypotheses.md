## D) Segmentation prioritization logic

Checklist:
- Prioritization logic (scoring or narrative)
- Buying-center dynamics by segment
- Deprioritized segments + rationale
- Explicit out-of-scope segments

## E) Core workflows (3–7)

Checklist:
- 3–7 workflows only (keep sharp)
- Each workflow written as: trigger → steps → outcome
- Identify who performs each step (role tags)
- Identify integration/data prerequisites where relevant

## F) Ranked jobs / pains / gains per segment

Checklist:
- Per segment: ranked JTBD, pains, gains
- Severity + frequency per pain (1–5)
- Success metrics (how they measure “done”)
- Inertia sources (why they don’t change)

## G) Candidate persona dossiers (hypotheses)

Checklist:
- Candidate persona stable ID (CPE-XXXX) and segment stable ID (SEG-XXXX)
- Objections, decision criteria, terminology/lexicon
- Quotes + incident stories + workarounds
- Evidence IDs attached to each major claim

Note:
- Candidate Personas (CPE-*) are **authoritative in <research>** as 1:1 proposals for downstream personas.
- Canonical Personas (PER-*) are **authoritative in <product-marketing> only**.
