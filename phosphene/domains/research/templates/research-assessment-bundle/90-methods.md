## C) Research intent + method (web) + source profile + bias notes

Checklist:
- Research intent (what decision(s) this supports)
- Method(s) used (web search, competitive scan, doc triangulation, desk research)
- Source profile (types + counts): docs, blogs, analyst notes, forums, reviews, filings, OSS repos
- Date range and freshness
- Bias notes (selection bias, survivorship, availability)
- Confidence grading approach (how you assigned C1–C3)

## C.1) Research log (queries + source trail)

Checklist:
- Search queries used (and why)
- “Source trail” notes (how you followed references)
- What you deliberately ignored (and why)

| Timestamp | Query / path | What you were testing | Sources opened |
|---|---|---|---|

## I) Quantification anchors (value ranges)

Checklist:
- Unit of value (time saved, risk reduced, revenue, compliance)
- Measurable vs not measurable
- Time-to-value bands (ranges)
- Any quantified anchors (even rough ranges) + what would firm them up

## J) Alternatives, switching costs, win/lose patterns

Checklist:
- Do-nothing baseline and inertia
- Switching costs (technical, org, procurement)
- Competitor comparisons (if any)
- Explicit “we lose when…” conditions

## K) Messaging ingredients (candidate; usable by `<product-marketing>`)

Checklist:
- Resonant phrases (quotes preferred)
- Taboo words / red-flag claims
- Narrative frames that worked
- Claim constraints (must/must-not)

## L) Prioritized use-case catalog (mapped)

Checklist:
- Use cases mapped to personas + triggers
- Integration/data prerequisites
- Dependencies and constraints per use case

## M) Capability constraints + non-negotiables

Checklist:
- Latency / performance requirements
- Auditability / compliance requirements
- Data residency / security posture
- Support model expectations (if relevant)

## N) Assumption register + gaps + validation plan

Checklist:
- Assumptions (explicit)
- Research gaps and unknowns
- Validation plan (next experiments)
- “Do not sell here” edge cases (explicit)
