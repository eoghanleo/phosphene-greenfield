## Snapshot summary

```text
[V-SCRIPT]:
update_persona_summary.sh
```

Systems-driven strategists are simulation enthusiasts who want an idle ant colony game to behave like a real system they can probe and master. They care about visible cause-and-effect, meaningful tradeoffs, and depth that rewards experimentation. They are willing to pay when monetization respects the simulation and keeps outcomes legitimate.

## Jobs

Each item has:
- ID format: `JTBD-JOB-0001-PER-0002` (types: `JOB|PAIN|GAIN`)
- Importance: 1–5 (5 = most important)

| JTBD-ID | Job | Importance |
|---|---|---:|
| JTBD-JOB-0002-PER-0002 | Run experiments on the colony economy and observe real consequences. They want to tweak variables, then see clear system responses. The job is to build mastery through cause-and-effect. | 5 |
| JTBD-JOB-0003-PER-0002 | Unlock deeper mechanics that expand strategy rather than just increase speed. They want new levers to pull so the sim stays interesting. The job is to feel agency inside the idle loop. | 4 |
| JTBD-JOB-0004-PER-0002 | Compare strategies across sessions with clear metrics. They want to know if a change improved output or stability. The job is to make optimization measurable. | 4 |
| JTBD-JOB-0005-PER-0002 | Trust that a browser-based sim can feel premium and responsive. They need proof that performance won’t undercut strategy. The job is to feel the platform matches their standards. | 3 |
| JTBD-JOB-0006-PER-0002 | Choose monetization paths that respect the simulation. They prefer optional support that doesn’t bypass strategy. The job is to back the game without breaking immersion. | 3 |

## Pains

```text
[V-SCRIPT]:
add_persona_jtbd_item.sh
update_persona_jtbd_item.sh
```

| JTBD-ID | Pain | Importance |
|---|---|---:|
| JTBD-PAIN-0001-PER-0002 | The game feels like a shallow idle reskin with minimal strategic depth. They can’t find systems to experiment with, so curiosity fades fast. This pain blocks long-term engagement. | 5 |
| JTBD-PAIN-0002-PER-0002 | Monetization shortcuts invalidate strategy by skipping the hard choices. The economy feels illegitimate and outcomes feel bought. This erodes trust in the simulation. | 4 |
| JTBD-PAIN-0003-PER-0002 | Web performance feels sluggish or visually thin, making the sim feel cheap. They worry the platform can’t carry depth. This creates hesitation to invest time. | 4 |
| JTBD-PAIN-0004-PER-0002 | Metrics are hidden or vague, so they can’t tell if a change worked. Strategy becomes guesswork instead of learning. This pain blocks experimentation. | 3 |
| JTBD-PAIN-0005-PER-0002 | Idle cycles feel like waiting instead of decision-making. They want strategy to matter more than timers. This makes the loop feel hollow. | 3 |

## Gains

```text

```

| JTBD-ID | Gain | Importance |
|---|---|---:|
| JTBD-GAIN-0001-PER-0002 | Strategic agency that changes colony behavior in visible ways. They want decisions to reshape the system, not just speed it up. The gain is feeling like a true strategist. | 5 |
| JTBD-GAIN-0002-PER-0002 | Emergent behaviors that reward curiosity and experimentation. They enjoy seeing surprising but logical outcomes from choices. The gain is discovery that feels earned. | 4 |
| JTBD-GAIN-0003-PER-0002 | Transparent metrics that show efficiency and tradeoffs. They can compare approaches without guesswork. The gain is confidence that strategy matters. | 4 |
| JTBD-GAIN-0004-PER-0002 | A web experience that feels premium and stable even with complex systems. They want smooth feedback and reliable performance. The gain is trust in the platform. | 3 |
| JTBD-GAIN-0005-PER-0002 | Monetization that supports the sim without undermining it. They can contribute through optional cosmetics or convenience. The gain is legitimacy and fairness. | 3 |
