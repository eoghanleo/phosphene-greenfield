## Domain

Primary domain: `<ideation>`

## Status

TODO (not in development). Do not run this domain in live flows.

## What you produce

- Ideas as repo artifacts:
  - `phosphene/domains/ideation/output/ideas/IDEA-*.md`

## How to work

- Create artifacts directly under `phosphene/domains/ideation/output/ideas/` (templates are intentionally not used).
- Keep the artifact short: problem/opportunity framing, target user hypotheses, and what to research next.
- Avoid over-committing to product definitions; treat as hypotheses for `<research>`.

## In-doc script hints (`[V-SCRIPT]`)

Some templates/artifacts include fenced code blocks that begin with `[V-SCRIPT]:`.
Search for `[V-SCRIPT]` when scanning an artifact to discover relevant control scripts for that section.

## Scripts (entrypoints and purpose)

No domain scripts yet.

## DONE signal

Not active. DONE receipt scripts are not implemented for this domain yet.
