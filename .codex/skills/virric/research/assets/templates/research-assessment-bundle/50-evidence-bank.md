Status: Draft
Updated: {{UPDATED}}

## H) Evidence pack (references + rubrics)

Checklist:
- Evidence bank includes quotes + incidents tagged to jobs/pains/gains (or context)
- Each evidence item has a stable EvidenceID (E-0001…)
- Evidence pointer (URL or repo path) + context (who/when)
- Evidence strength (E0–E4) + confidence (C1–C3)

Rubrics:
- Evidence strength (E):
  - E0 = assertion only
  - E1 = single anecdote
  - E2 = multiple consistent anecdotes
  - E3 = triangulated (anecdotes + data/doc)
  - E4 = quantified impact + triangulated
- Confidence (C):
  - C1 = low (needs validation)
  - C2 = medium (plausible, incomplete)
  - C3 = high (reliable enough for downstream work)
