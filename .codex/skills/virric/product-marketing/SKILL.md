## Domain

Primary domain: `<product-marketing>`

## What you produce

- Personas: `virric/domains/product-marketing/docs/personas/PER-*.md`
- Propositions: `virric/domains/product-marketing/docs/propositions/PROP-*.md`

## How to work

- Start from `<research>` outputs:
  - Candidate Personas: `CPE-*` docs inside the RA bundle (`60-candidate-personas/`)
  - Segments/persona hypotheses, EvidenceIDs, and the pitch set
- Use templates under `virric/domains/product-marketing/templates/`.
- Treat personas/segments as hypotheses unless validated; include confidence and EvidenceIDs when making claims.
- When creating a canonical Persona (PER-*), treat it as a **promotion** of one or more CPE candidates (cite source CPE IDs).

## Receipts (recommended)

Write a `DONE.json` receipt adjacent to each produced artifact listing:

- inputs (pointers to research bundle files / EvidenceIDs)
- outputs (PER/PROP docs)
- checks run (format/header compliance; any domain validators if/when added)
