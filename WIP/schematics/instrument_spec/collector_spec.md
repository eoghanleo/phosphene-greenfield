      The `COLLECTOR` is an apparatus that acquires raw phos from outside the reactor and refines it into a usable form. Operationally, it is how the reactor gains new information: ingesting external sources (research, docs, datasets, transcripts, reference repos) and transforming them into repo-native artifacts that can be verified, versioned, and coupled back into the main beam. A collector emits the same kind of durable completion receipt as other apparatus, so downstream detectors can treat ingestion as verifiable work rather than a narrative claim.

### Purpose

- [Define the canonical intent of the collector.]

### Responsibilities

- [Ingest external sources and produce repo-native artifacts.]

### Inputs (expected)

- [External sources, constraints, and scope.]

### Outputs (signals / side effects)

- [Artifacts, DONE receipts, commits on branch beams.]

### Trigger surface

- [How the collector is summoned.]

### Configuration

- [Config keys used, defaults, and overrides.]

### Constraints

- [Script-first rules and allowed outputs.]

### Idempotency

- [How collectors avoid duplicate outputs or ensure safe re-runs.]

### Failure modes

- [Known failures and remediation loop entry.]

### Observability

- [Logs, summaries, and artifacts to inspect.]

### Open questions

- [Outstanding decisions or required clarifications.]
