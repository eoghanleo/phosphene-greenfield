      The `PRISM` is the dispatcher: it splits and aims branch beams, fanning work out into an execution context without doing the work itself. In practice, that means it issues the minimal execution anchor inside the reactor (for example, a prism-owned branch beam reference and a prism-issued ID), and it issues the summons that starts the apparatus running. If the detector is the judge, the prism is the stage manager: it sets the scene, points the spotlight, and then gets out of the way.
