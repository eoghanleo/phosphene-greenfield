## PHOSFLOW (canonical)

PHOSFLOW is the **single** standard notation for reactor sections.

- **Everything is Mermaid** (flowcharts).
- **Conventions matter more than wording**.
- **Signals are wireless**: an edge label implies “signal emitted → downstream reacts”; we do not draw “commit bus / detect bus” steps.
