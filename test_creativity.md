# Test Creativity - Ant Colony Idle Game Vision

## Assumptions
- The experience must honor PRD-001 constraints: fair progress, optional spend only, web-first with chat continuity, and trustable persistence.
- WebGPU-class visuals are available on the web surface; chat supports lightweight cards and quick actions.
- This document is a vision of the application experience and UX, not a requirements or scope declaration.

## Vision (one line)
A calm, living colony you can check in on for minutes or explore for hours - always fair, always transparent, always evolving.

## The Actual Application Experience

### First session (3-5 minutes)
You land inside a soft-lit cross-section of a living nest. Ants move with believable purpose, not as sprites but as tiny, intelligible agents. A brief, gentle prompt asks you to choose a first focus: **Food**, **Brood**, or **Exploration**. You pick one lever, watch the colony reorganize, and see immediate, visible change - not numbers climbing, but tunnels humming, larvae fed, or scouts returning. You end with a **Return Recap** card that shows what changed and offers a single next step. The last screen is a **Fairness Pledge**: optional upgrades are labeled, never required, and tracked transparently.

### Returning (the daily ritual)
You re-enter to a **Return Recap Loop**: a one-screen snapshot of what progressed while you were away, a tiny "why it happened" note, and a single recommended next move. You can take it in 30 seconds or dive deeper. A **Discovery Pulse** appears periodically - a new ant role, a soil layer, a foraging pattern - keeping the loop fresh without overwhelming.

### Deep play (the strategist session)
Opening **Experimentation Studio** shifts the interface into a lab. You can compare two strategies side-by-side, capture a snapshot, and see a forecast of outcomes. The **Colony Notebook** records each experiment with a simple hypothesis line, the chosen lever, and the observed result. The simulation feels credible because the colony evolves in visibly consistent ways.

### Chat continuity (the companion surface)
In chat, the colony is a companion, not a toy. You see a crisp **Status Card** (progress delta, one highlight, one action). You can collect, assign, or queue a next focus without leaving chat. The **Trust Vault** shows your last sync and guarantees no loss of progress. The chat surface is deliberately lightweight and always points back to the full web experience for deep play.

### Long-term cadence (the soft arc)
The colony develops in seasons: new roles, new dilemmas, and gentle narrative microbeats that feel like discoveries rather than quests. Each milestone produces a **Memory Album** card you can keep or share. The sense of time is soothing - the colony is always alive, always becoming.

## Core Loop (the heartbeat)
1. Observe a living change in the colony.
2. Choose one lever (upgrade, allocation, or experiment).
3. Run a short session or schedule a longer cadence.
4. See a visible, interpretable outcome.
5. Capture the result (recap or notebook).
6. Set a calm, optional next step.

## Key Features (what makes this feel inevitable)
- **Fair Progress Hub**: a home screen that makes fairness legible - no hidden paywalls, optional upgrades labeled, and a one-tap economy ledger.
- **Return Recap Loop**: a compact recap that respects time and always ends with a single clear next action.
- **Discovery Cadence Engine**: gentle, periodic novelty that keeps the loop fresh without spiking cognitive load.
- **Experimentation Studio + Colony Notebook**: structured experiments with snapshots, comparisons, and searchable history.
- **Strategy Guidance Layer**: light AI hints that explain consequences without removing agency.
- **In-Chat Launch + Continuity**: a chat-native status card and quick actions that always feel safe to use.
- **Trust Vault + Ledger**: explicit persistence and economy transparency that makes the system feel honest.
- **Colony Memory Album**: a visual diary of milestones that doubles as a social proof artifact.
- **Quiet Night Mode Scheduler**: a soft, low-intensity mode for late-night, low-stimulus play.
- **Accessibility Comfort Layer**: reduced motion, simplified surfaces, and clear typography by default.

## Key UI/UX (what it looks and feels like)
- **Colony Canvas**: the main view is a living cross-section with subtle motion, soft audio, and clear visual payoffs.
- **Fair Progress Hub (home)**: a centered progress ring, a single "next step" card, and a pinned fairness pledge.
- **Return Recap Ribbon**: a top strip that summarizes the last session in three nouns and one number.
- **Experimentation Studio**: split-view compare, a small "forecast" dial, and a button to snapshot outcomes.
- **Ledger Drawer**: a slide-up panel showing what changed, why it changed, and what was optional spend.
- **Chat Status Card**: a compact view with one highlight, one action, and a trust stamp for last sync.
- **Pacing Templates**: "3-minute check-in," "15-minute deep play," and "set-and-return" modes.

## Distinctiveness (why this isn't another idle game)
- **Trustable fairness is a feature, not a promise**: the ledger and trust vault are permanent, visible UI elements.
- **A dual-speed experience without bifurcation**: casual and strategist needs are served in one coherent interface.
- **A living simulation, not a number treadmill**: you see behavior, not just stats.
- **Chat as continuity, not a gimmick**: the chat surface is a safety-first companion, not the whole game.
- **Discovery over pressure**: novelty arrives as small, delightful reveals rather than forced events.

## Selection Rationale
- **Core bet:** a calm, living colony experience that earns trust through fairness and transparency.
- **Trade-off:** slower monetization in exchange for long-term retention and shareable delight.
- **Trade-off:** chat is intentionally lightweight to preserve simulation credibility on the web.
- **Constraint:** fairness and optional spend are non-negotiable, shaping every surface.
- **Constraint:** persistence trust must be explicit and visible to reduce fear of loss.

## Open Questions
- How deep can WebGPU-class simulation go without breaking accessibility targets?
- What is the smallest viable "Trust Vault" that still earns confidence?
- Which discoveries should be time-based versus action-based?
- How often can Discovery Pulses occur without feeling noisy?
- What is the minimum set of experiments needed to satisfy strategists early?
- Which moments are most shareable without feeling performative?
- What does "fair" monetization look like in the first six weeks of retention?
