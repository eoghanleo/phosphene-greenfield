## AGENTS.md (repo root)

This repo is a **VIRRIC framework sandbox** and is actively evolving.

If you are an agent doing work in this repo:
- Read the canonical agent entrypoint: `virric/AGENTS.md`
- Skim the working design note if needed: `VIRRIC_STATE_MACHINE_WORKING.md`
- Skills are mandatory and live in: `.codex/skills/virric/**`

This root file is intentionally lightweight; domain and workflow contracts live under `virric/`.
