## AGENTS.md (repo root)

This repo is a **PHOSPHENE framework sandbox** and is actively evolving.

If you are an agent doing work in this repo:
- Read the canonical agent entrypoint: `phosphene/AGENTS.md`
- Skills are mandatory and live in: `.codex/skills/phosphene/**`

This root file is intentionally lightweight; domain and workflow contracts live under `phosphene/`.
