# AGENTS.md (domain stub) — <scrum-management>

Primary domain: `<scrum-management>`

This domain uses the canonical VIRRIC handoff at `virric/AGENTS.md`.

## What you produce

- `issue` artifacts (work tracking; delegation scaffolds)

## Operating boundary

- Use the `<scrum-management>` tag to indicate scope/boundaries in handoffs.
- Avoid “go to this directory” pointers inside handoff/spec docs; those can hijack an agent early.
- Artifacts for this domain live in canonical `docs/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, and `signals/` areas within the repo.
