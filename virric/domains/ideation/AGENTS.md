# AGENTS.md (domain stub) — <ideation>

Primary domain: `<ideation>`

This domain uses the canonical VIRRIC handoff at `virric/AGENTS.md`.

## What you produce

- `idea` artifacts (seed concepts; minimal structure)

## Operating boundary

- Use the `<ideation>` tag to indicate scope/boundaries in handoffs.
- Avoid “go to this directory” pointers inside handoff/spec docs; those can hijack an agent early.
- Artifacts for this domain live in canonical `docs/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, and `signals/` areas within the repo.
