## Purpose + constraints (read first)

This document is a **web-research-only research assessment**. It is a cover letter that distills key findings and hypotheses for downstream work in `<product-marketing>`, `<product-strategy>`, and `<product-management>`.

Hard constraints for the research agent:
- No interviews; assume only public web sources.
- Primary outputs are reference solutions, competitive landscape, and candidate product pitches grounded in public evidence.
- Outputs are candidate segments/personas/pains/gains (theories) with evidence pointers and confidence grades.
- Product definition and scope should remain light; capture only what is necessary to frame pitches and hypotheses.

## Research coversheet (target: 1–2 pages)

### 1) Mission + deliverables + sprint success criteria

Mission:
- <what decision this enables>

Deliverables (expected):
- Reference solutions scan (market + academic) with stable IDs and pointers (RS-*)
- Competitive landscape summary (categories + key players + positioning)
- 3–7 candidate product pitches (PITCH-*) with EvidenceIDs + confidence
- Candidate segments (SEG-*) ranked, with rationale + out-of-scope list
- Candidate personas (PER-*) per top segment (hypotheses)
- Candidate jobs/pains/gains (IDs) per segment with severity/frequency (hypotheses)
- Evidence bank (EvidenceID + excerpt + pointer + strength/confidence)
- 5–15 key claims with confidence grades (what seems true from web sources)

Sprint success criteria:
- <what must be true at the end>

Downstream consumers & needs:
- `<product-marketing>`:
  - Needs: segments/personas + pitches + evidence for claims
- `<product-strategy>`:
  - Needs: competitive landscape + pitch set + key constraints/risks
- `<product-management>`:
  - Needs: top pitch(es) + evidence + assumptions/unknowns for validation

### 2) Scope, grounding, and what we don’t know

Minimal product grounding:
- Might be: <one sentence>
- Likely isn’t: <one sentence>

Scope boundaries:
- Industries:
- Geographies:
- Buyer types:
- Explicit out-of-scope:

Unknowns (not resolvable via web research):
- <unknown 1>

Assumptions made to proceed:
- <assumption 1>

### 3) Top hypotheses snapshot (theories)

Top candidate segments (ranked):
- SEG-0001: <name>
  - Wedge hypothesis:
  - Top pains (P-0001, P-0002, P-0003):
  - Top gains (G-0001, G-0002, G-0003):
  - Buying-center map (if inferable):
  - Triggers / why-now:

### 4) Key findings (evidence-backed)

Include 5–15 claims. Each should cite EvidenceIDs.

- Claim:
  - Why it matters:
  - EvidenceIDs: E-0001, E-0002
  - Confidence (C1–C3):
  - Notes / caveats:

### 5) Candidate product pitches (stepping stones)

List the pitch set here (details live in `30-pitches/`):
- PITCH-0001: <name> — Confidence: C2 — EvidenceIDs: E-0002, E-0005
- PITCH-0002: <name> — Confidence: C1 — EvidenceIDs: E-0009, E-0010

### 6) Downstream handoff (do not finalize here)

What to do next (high level):
- `<product-marketing>` should turn pitches + hypotheses into personas/propositions and messaging tests.
- `<product-strategy>` should select a pitch (or reject) based on competition + constraints + risks.
- `<product-management>` should plan validation experiments for the chosen pitch and define a first spec slice.
