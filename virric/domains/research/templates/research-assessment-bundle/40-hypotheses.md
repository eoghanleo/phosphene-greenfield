## D) Segmentation prioritization logic

Checklist:

- Identify who performs each step (role tags)
- Identify integration/data prerequisites where relevant

## F) Ranked jobs / pains / gains per segment

Checklist:
- Per segment: ranked JTBD, pains, gains
- Severity + frequency per pain (1–5)
- Success metrics (how they measure “done”)
- Inertia sources (why they don’t change)

## G) Candidate persona dossiers (hypotheses)

Checklist:
- Persona stable ID (PER-XXXX) and segment stable ID (SEG-XXXX)
- Objections, decision criteria, terminology/lexicon
- Quotes + incident stories + workarounds
- Evidence IDs attached to each major claim
