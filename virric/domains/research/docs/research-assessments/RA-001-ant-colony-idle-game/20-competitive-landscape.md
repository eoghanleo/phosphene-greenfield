## B) Competitive landscape + relative competition

Checklist:
- Identify direct/adjacent competitors and category substitutes
- Summarize positioning and differentiation axes
- Capture win/lose patterns (“we lose when…”) as hypotheses
- Note switching costs and inertia drivers

## Competitive landscape table

| Competitor | Category | ICP/segment | Positioning claim | Key strengths | Key weaknesses | “We lose when…” | Pointer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Idle Ants (Madbox) | Idle / hypercasual | SEG-0001 | “Pure fun idle: watch ants eat everything.” | Accessible; viral visuals; strong UA. | Shallow loop; not a sim; ad fatigue. | We lose casual attention if onboarding is heavy or visuals underwhelm. | `https://play.google.com/` |
| Idle Ant Colony (Bling) | Idle / mid-core | SEG-0001/2 | “Build an ant empire” with more systems. | More strategic content; ongoing updates; community. | Mobile-first; pacing complaints; onboarding overload. | We lose if we ship “sandbox only” without goals or if differentiation is weak. | `https://play.google.com/` |
| Mainstream idle tycoons | Idle / economy | SEG-0001 | “Manage X and get rich.” | Tuned progression; polish; huge content cadence. | Generic themes; aggressive monetization norms. | We lose if novelty doesn’t outweigh inertia and tuning quality. | `https://play.google.com/` |
| Empires of the Undergrowth | PC strategy/sim | SEG-0002 | “Ant colony warfare with realism.” | Depth; realism; premium/fairness perception. | Paid/PC barrier; no idle/offline loop. | We lose enthusiasts if our sim feels toy-like or dishonest. | `https://store.steampowered.com/` |
| AntWar.io | Browser PvP (.io) | SEG-0001 subset | “Real-time ant colony battles.” | Low barrier; competitive hook. | Not idle; not sim; low depth/LTV. | We lose users seeking PvP if we misposition as “war.” | `https://antwar.io/` |
| Educational sims | Sandbox/edu | SEG-0003 adjacent | “Learn by observing.” | Credibility; curriculum alignment. | Not sticky; low polish; low distribution. | We lose edu usage if seen as too gamey/monetized. | `https://graphics.cs.uh.edu/` |
