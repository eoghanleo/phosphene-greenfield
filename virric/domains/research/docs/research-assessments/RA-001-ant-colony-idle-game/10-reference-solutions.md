## A) Reference solution scan (market + academic)

Checklist:
- Scan for similar ideas in-market (products, startups, OSS)
- Scan for similar ideas academically (papers, preprints, labs)
- Capture each as a ReferenceSolution with a stable ID + pointer
- Extract what to borrow vs avoid (patterns, claims, pitfalls)

## Reference solutions table

| RefSolID | Type (Market/Academic) | Name | 1–2 line summary | What to borrow | What to avoid | Pointer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RS-0001 | Market | Idle Ants (Madbox) | Hypercasual ant-themed idle; very large acquisition. | Simple, satisfying visuals; frictionless loop; web portal presence. | One-note loop; ad fatigue; shallow sim. | `https://play.google.com/` |
| RS-0002 | Market | Empires of the Undergrowth | Premium PC ant RTS/sim with realism and strong reception. | Realism + presentation; species variety; depth for enthusiasts. | High barrier (paid/PC); no idle loop; content hunger. | `https://store.steampowered.com/` |
| RS-0003 | Market | Swarm Simulator: Evolution | 3D remake of an insect incremental; strong idle progression patterns. | Deep incremental systems; “numbers → visuals” bridge; prestige. | QoL gated by currency; steep learning curve. | `https://store.steampowered.com/` |
| RS-0004 | Market | Idle Ant Colony (Bling Bling Games) | Mid-core mobile ant idle; moderate traction with ongoing updates. | Multiple progression tracks; community/update cadence. | Onboarding overload; pacing/grind later. | `https://play.google.com/` |
| RS-0005 | Academic | GPU Ant Colony Simulation (Dan Andersen) | GPU-based pheromone-following ant simulation (technical demo). | Parallel simulation approach; pheromone modeling patterns. | Demo lacks UX/game loop; performance traps if unbounded. | `https://github.com/` |
| RS-0006 | Market | ChatGPT Apps SDK (OpenAI) | New distribution surface: embedded web apps inside ChatGPT. | Embedded UX paradigm; potential frictionless checkout. | Discovery uncertainty; policy/review risk; platform dependence. | `https://openai.com/` |
