## One-line pitch

A series of detailed idle simulations (Ants, Bees, Termites, …) on a shared WebGPU engine — reuse tech, vary themes, and get multiple “at-bats” for distribution and marketing.

## Target

- Target segment(s): SEG-0002 (primary), SEG-0001 (per-theme casual wedges)
- Target persona(s): PER-0002 (and “nature-curious” variants)

## Trigger / why-now

- Nature themes are resonant; a high-quality first title can justify reusing the core engine.

## Core pain → promised gain

- Pain: single-game content drought; hard to achieve scale with one niche theme.
- Gain: portfolio strategy; cumulative reach; re-skin capability for new audiences.

## So it works because… (mechanism, not scope)

- The expensive part (agent-based simulation + rendering + progression skeleton) is reusable.
- Each new theme becomes a “marketing wedge” while sharing infrastructure.

## Differentiation vs reference solutions

- Rather than competing head-on with one massive idle tycoon, this is a portfolio compounding bet.

## Likely objections + counters

- “Spreading focus dilutes quality.” → only pursue after first title shows traction; stagger releases.
- “Players won’t care about other themes.” → test cross-theme interest in-product before investing.

## We lose when…

- Follow-up titles are low-polish or too similar (cannibalization + reputation damage).
- Engine doesn’t generalize (tech debt explodes).

## Unknowns to validate next

- Cross-theme demand (survey/telemetry).
- Engine generalizability (prototype second theme quickly).
- Distribution constraints for cross-promo across platforms.
