# skill.md (domain stub) — <product-marketing>

This is a lightweight pointer for agents that support `skill.md`.

- Canonical skills: `virric/skill.md`
- Domain tag: `<product-marketing>`
- This domain contains `docs/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, and `signals/` inventories (avoid path pointers in handoffs; use `<product-marketing>` instead).
